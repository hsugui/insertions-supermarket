# E-commerce Mock Data Generator (Java)

This repository contains a Java program I developed to populate an Oracle database with mock data for testing an e-commerce application (frontend and backend). The tool generates realistic test data to simulate customers, addresses, products, stock, and orders.

## Purpose
When building and testing an e-commerce system, having realistic data is essential for:
- Functional testing of features.
- Performance testing and database queries.
- Demonstrating the application with meaningful examples.
This program automates data insertion, saving time compared to manual entry.
